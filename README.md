6. **program-to-display-total-amount.cpp** - Program to display total amount calculations
7. **Rectangle-Class-with-Area-Calculation.cpp** - Object-oriented programming with Rectangle class
8. **to-add-two-object-private-data-members-feet-inches.cpp** - Advanced Distance class with object addition, constructors, and data validation
9. **using-DMA-age-of-n-student.cpp** - Dynamic Memory Allocation for student age management

## Featured Programs

### üéì Student Record Management System
- **File**: `program-that-store-n-r-m-of-5-sub.cpp`
- **Features**: Enhanced with proper input handling, clear subject prompts, and professional output formatting
- **Concepts**: Classes, objects, arrays, input validation

### üìè Distance Addition System
- **File**: `to-add-two-object-private-data-members-feet-inches.cpp`
- **Features**: 
  - Multiple constructors (default and parameterized)
  - Private helper methods for data validation
  - Automatic inch overflow handling (converts 12+ inches to feet)
  - Object addition with proper encapsulation
- **Concepts**: Advanced OOP, constructors, private methods, data normalization

## How to Compile and Run

To compile any of these programs, use:
```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o filename
./filename
```

### Example Usage:
```bash
# Compile the Distance program
g++ to-add-two-object-private-data-members-feet-inches.cpp -o distance

# Run the program
./distance
```

### Sample Output:
```
=== Distance Addition Program ===

--- Using predefined values ---
Distance 1: Feet: 7, Inches: 8
Distance 2: Feet: 9, Inches: 7
Sum: Feet: 17, Inches: 3
```
